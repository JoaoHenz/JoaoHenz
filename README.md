### Hello! My name is JoÃ£o Henz! ðŸ‘‹

A software engineer hungry for knowledge and new challenges!

I've been working for three years in the game development industry and it is an area I have a deep appreciation for and I am always searching for new ways to grow in it. I am also a big fan of procedural generation and machine learning - my computer science conclusion work was in the area of Procedural Terrain Generation via Machine Learning. 

I love working with more people, coordinating our efforts and dealing with difficult programming challenges. In my experience leading teams, I am happy when I can optimize processes and enable the people inside it to better develop their skills.

I am currently working at Izyplay Game Studio in Porto Alegre. You can check my old and current projects at my portfolio:
